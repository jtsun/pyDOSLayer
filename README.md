## Layer plotting DOS code

### Requirements
* Python
* Numpy
* Matplotlib

### Setup
* To use this, you need to have, `OUTCAR`, `CONTCAR` and `DOSCAR` in the directory.
* You also need to have the file `sh_vasp.py` either in the directory *or* in your `PYTHONPATH`.

### Use
* Once you have those things set up then you just need to play with this script.
* See the sample notebook `slab_example.ipynb`, it contains all the code needed.
* The parameters you need to set are direction and number of bins - I think the meaning of these is quite clear.

### To-do

* Automate more
* Allow writing of output files rather than plotting
